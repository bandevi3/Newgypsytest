CPUs are what you see when you run htop (these do not equate to physical CPUs).

Here is an example from a desktop machine:

$ lscpu | egrep '^Thread|^Core|^Socket|^CPU\('
CPU(s):                8
Thread(s) per core:    2
Core(s) per socket:    4
Socket(s):             1

And a server:

$ lscpu | egrep '^Thread|^Core|^Socket|^CPU\('
CPU(s):                32
Thread(s) per core:    2
Core(s) per socket:    8
Socket(s):             2

The output of nproc corresponds to the CPU count from lscpu. For the desktop machine above this should match the 8 CPU(s) reported by lscpu:

$ nproc --all
8

The output of /proc/cpuinfo should match this information, for example on the desktop system above we can see there are 8 processors (CPUs) and 4 cores (core id 0-3):

$ egrep 'processor|core id' /proc/cpuinfo
processor   : 0
core id     : 0
processor   : 1
core id     : 0
processor   : 2
core id     : 1
processor   : 3
core id     : 1
processor   : 4
core id     : 2
processor   : 5
core id     : 2
processor   : 6
core id     : 3
processor   : 7
core id     : 3


 grep -m 1 'cpu cores' /proc/cpuinfo
cpu cores   : 4

To specifically answer your question you tell how many cores you have by multiplying the number of cores you have per socket by the number of sockets you have.

    Cores = Cores per socket X Sockets

For the example systems above the desktop has 4 cores:

$ echo Cores = $(( $(lscpu | awk '/^Socket/{ print $2 }') * $(lscpu | awk '/^Core/{ print $4 }') ))
Cores = 4

While the server has 16:

$ echo Cores = $(( $(lscpu | awk '/^Socket/{ print $2 }') * $(lscpu | awk '/^Core/{ print $4 }') ))
Cores = 16

Another useful utility is dmidecode which outputs per socket information. In the case of the server system listed above we expect to see 8 cores per socket and 16 threads per socket:

$ sudo dmidecode -t 4 | egrep 'Socket Designation|Count'
    Socket Designation: CPU1
    Core Count: 8
    Thread Count: 16
    Socket Designation: CPU2
    Core Count: 8
    Thread Count: 16

In summary:

    You need to be aware of sockets, cores and threads
    You need to be careful of the term CPU as it means different things in different contexts
